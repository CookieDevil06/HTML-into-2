            <p>I have been spending a lot of tme during the pandemic playing games. I was doing this to pass the time when I was waiting for school or just wanting to do something after my assingments.
                Though recently I started skating again which I haven't done in a long time. I even started taking pseed skate classes recently because I really enjoyed going fast on my skates.
